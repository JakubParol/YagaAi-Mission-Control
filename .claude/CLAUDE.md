## Startup Instructions

On session start, you MUST follow the full drill-down from AGENTS.md:

1. Read AGENTS.md (auto-loaded above)
2. Read ALL mandatory references listed in "Required Reading":
   - `/home/kuba/.openclaw/standards/coding-standards.md`
   - `/home/kuba/.openclaw/standards/documentation.md`
   - `docs/INDEX.md`
3. From docs/INDEX.md, read the mandatory doc: `docs/REPO_MAP.md`
4. Report what you read before proceeding

When the user tells you what they're working on, drill into that project:
- Read the project's AGENTS.md and its mandatory refs
- Read the project's docs/INDEX.md
- Choose what else to read based on the task
- Report what you additionally read
