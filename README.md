# Mission Control (YagaAi)

**Mission Control** is the central coordination layer for **OpenClaw** within the **YagaAi** ecosystem.

It acts as the operational brain that:

- Orchestrates agents and sub‑agents
- Tracks missions, goals, and execution state
- Integrates tools, nodes, and external services
- Provides visibility and control over autonomous and semi‑autonomous workflows

Mission Control is designed to support practical, real‑world AI operations rather than demos — focusing on reliability, observability, and human‑in‑the‑loop control.

## Relationship to YagaAi

Mission Control is part of **YagaAi** — an experimental but production‑minded umbrella project exploring applied AI systems, agent architectures, and automation.

While YagaAi is a broader playground, Mission Control is where ideas become **operational systems**.

## OpenClaw Integration

Within OpenClaw, Mission Control:

- Serves as the command layer for agent execution
- Defines mission boundaries and constraints
- Coordinates tooling, permissions, and context
- Enables safe scaling of agentic behavior
